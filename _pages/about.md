I am a professor of AI & Optimization Techniques for Business & Society in [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) (UvA), where I am a faculty member at the [Business Analytics](https://abs.uva.nl/content/sections/operations-management/operations-management.html) section of the [Amsterdam Business School](https://abs.uva.nl/) (ABS). 

In the past, I had served for three years as a professor of Data Science and Optimization at the [Department of Econometrics](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics) of [Erasmus University](https://www.eur.nl/) (EUR), and before EUR, I had been a professor of optimization at the [Industrial Engineering Department](https://ie.sabanciuniv.edu/) of [SabancÄ± University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/) for more than a decade.

My **research interests** center around optimization methods in data science and decision making. Lately, I am interested in interpretable machine learning and data privacy in operations research.

Recent News
------
- We have released our new meta-learning algorithm LEarning with Subset Stacking (LESS). The Python package and the tutorials are available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sibirbil/LESS). You can also read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06251) on arXiv.

- Our work on mixed-integer optimization with constraint learning is accepted to Decision Optimization Workshop in [36th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-22/).

- We have three new papers on arXiv. The [first one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10498) is about differential privacy in multi-party resource sharing, the [second one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04469) is about optimization with constraint learning, and the [last one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07058) is about an alternative stochastic gradient method for training deep learning models.
- We organized a [workshop](https://optimal.uva.nl/content/events/events/2021/09/machine-learning-for-optimization-workshop.html) on machine learning for optimization. All presentations and recordings are available on the [workshop's website](https://optimal.uva.nl/content/events/events/2021/09/machine-learning-for-optimization-workshop.html).
- I am now an affiliated researcher of [OPTIMAL](https://optimal.uva.nl).
- We organized a [fall school](https://nesinkoyleri.org/events/2021-yapay-ogrenme-icin-matematik/) on mathematics of machine learning in [Nesin Villages](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/nesin-villages/).

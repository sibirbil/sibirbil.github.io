## Blogs

[Bol Bilim](https://bolbilim.com/): With [Pınar Yolum](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/PYolumBirbil), we have been writing about the academic life, i.e, writing papers, preparing talks, getting ready for lectures, and so on. (in Turkish). We also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzKzqD6nxTyuHwPJwVRNe3g).

[Veri Deferi](http://www.veridefteri.com/): With two of my friends, we share our notes on data science. Here is one [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZcbvMjrj9DVU6g2A5e6voeigUtSMsAJH), where we recorded my lectures on introduction to machine learning in Istanbul.

## Articles

I occasionally write articles for newspapers and magazines. I did have a steady run in the past:

- Weekly articles mostly about science policy in BirGün Pazar, 2016-2018
- Weekly [popular science column](http://www.radikal.com.tr/index/ilker-birbil/) in Radikal newspaper, 2012-2014
